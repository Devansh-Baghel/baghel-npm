# NPM Portfolio

I have created this [npm package](https://npmjs.com/package/baghel) to reserve a package under my name in the npm registry for later use.

I intend on making this a cli app where someone can know about me, my projects, get links to my socials etc... by running `npx baghel`

This project is inspired from [this repo](https://github.com/anmol098/npx_card) and [these](https://dev.to/harshhhdev/creating-a-npx-introduction-card-782) [articles](https://studioelsa.se/blog/open-source-oss-npx-business-card/).
